# Simple React Login with Mongodb

## describe
The assignment will consist of a login page that allows the user to both login to an existing account and
register a new account. <br> 
We will be using the MERN Stack implemented in Javascript. <br> <br>
(Required to implement a simple login client that connect to server with mongodb database storage.) <br>

## install
Need to install dependencies before running the project:
* open terminal in `cd server` directory
* run: `npm run install-server` 
* run: `npm run install-client`

## Running
* run: `npm start`

## assumings
I keep the project as simple as I can, <br>
it's assignment for 2 hours, so implements things the really for this time. <br>
Using React Material UI components, redux thunk.

BUT wish to implement necessary features like: 
- dotenv files
- express validator
- authentication: passport / jwt
- logger 
- docker & docker-compose files and running
- lintjs
- prettier 
- hash passwords
- google api
- Sass 
- responsive client
- ES6 modules
- unit tests
- integration tests (with selenium / puppeteer)
etc...
